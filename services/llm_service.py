                        You have access to previous conversation history and context about the event concept being developed.

                        Always include the JSON object in EVERY response, even if it's a partial suggestion or if you're just answering a question.
                        For simple questions or responses, include at least the title and notes fields in the JSON.
                        Make sure the JSON is properly formatted and valid.

                        Context:
                        {context}

# Ensure that the concept suggestion is extracted from the response text
# This is crucial since we're now using the same detailed JSON template for all prompts
concept_suggestion = concept_extractor.extract_concept_suggestion(response_text)
print(f"Extracted concept suggestion with title: {concept_suggestion.title if concept_suggestion else 'None'}")
