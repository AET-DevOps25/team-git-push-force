# LLM Service Refactoring

## Overview

The LLM service has been refactored to reduce complexity by splitting it into multiple files with clear responsibilities. This refactoring maintains backward compatibility with the existing API while improving maintainability and readability.

## Files

### llm_service.py

The main service file that provides the public API for the LLM service. It delegates most of its functionality to the specialized services.

- Initializes the LLM model
- Processes chat requests
- Maintains backward compatibility with the original API

### concept_extractor.py

Handles the extraction of concept suggestions from LLM responses.

- Extracts structured concept data from JSON responses
- Provides fallback extraction from text responses for backward compatibility
- Handles various edge cases in the extraction process

### response_generator.py

Generates responses, suggestions, and follow-up questions based on concept suggestions.

- Creates ChatResponse objects
- Generates dynamic suggestions based on concept content
- Generates follow-up questions based on concept content

### welcome_generator.py

Generates welcome messages for new chat sessions.

- Creates personalized welcome messages for new concepts
- Provides fallback messages in case of errors

## Dependencies

The services are initialized in the following order:

1. `llm_service.py` initializes the LLM model
2. `concept_extractor.py` is initialized as a standalone service
3. `response_generator.py` is initialized with a reference to the concept extractor
4. `welcome_generator.py` is initialized with a reference to the LLM model

## Backward Compatibility

The refactored code maintains backward compatibility with the original API:

- The `llm_service` singleton instance is still available
- The `process_chat_request` and `generate_welcome_message` functions are still exported
- The `_generate_dynamic_suggestions` and `_generate_dynamic_follow_up_questions` methods are maintained for backward compatibility

## Future Improvements

- Update imports in other files to use the specialized services directly
- Add unit tests for each specialized service
- Update the API to use more consistent naming conventions
