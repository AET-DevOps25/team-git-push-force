# Gateway Service

This service acts as an API Gateway for the application, routing requests to the appropriate microservices.

## Overview
This code was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project and has been extended to provide gateway functionality.

## Local Development

When running the gateway service locally (outside of Docker), you need to activate the `local` profile to ensure the service can connect to other services running on your local machine.

### Running Locally

To run the gateway service locally:

1. Make sure the user-svc, concept-svc, and genai-svc services are running locally on their respective ports:
   - user-svc: http://localhost:8081
   - concept-svc: http://localhost:8082
   - genai-svc: http://localhost:8083

2. Start the gateway service with the `local` profile activated:

   ```bash
   # If using Gradle
   ./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=local'

   # If using Maven
   mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
   ```

### Configuration

The application is configured to use the following service URLs:

- In Docker environment:
  - user-svc: http://user-svc:8080
  - concept-svc: http://concept-svc:8080
  - genai-svc: http://genai-svc:8083

- In local environment (with `local` profile):
  - user-svc: http://localhost:8081
  - concept-svc: http://localhost:8082
  - genai-svc: http://localhost:8083

You can also override these URLs using environment variables:
- USER_SERVICE_URL
- CONCEPT_SERVICE_URL
- GENAI_SERVICE_URL

## API Implementation

The stubs generated can be used in your existing Spring-MVC or Spring-Boot application to create controller endpoints
by adding ```@Controller``` classes that implement the interface. Eg:
```java
@Controller
public class PetController implements PetApi {
// implement all PetApi methods
}
```

You can also use the interface to create [Spring-Cloud Feign clients](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/spring-cloud.html#spring-cloud-feign-inheritance).Eg:
```java
@FeignClient(name="pet", url="http://petstore.swagger.io/v2")
public interface PetClient extends PetApi {

}
```
