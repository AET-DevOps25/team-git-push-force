## Purpose

### What is the main functionality?

An interactive **co-creation assistant** that turns a vague event idea into a polished concept‚Äîfast. The planner drags in any relevant documents (past reports, industry papers, brand decks). The AI digests that material, asks follow-up questions until all gaps are filled, and delivers a full concept package: theme, format, agenda outline, speaker & sponsor suggestions, and ticket-price ideas, exportable as PDF and JSON. Because the AI does the heavy lifting‚Äîresearching, matching, structuring‚Äîit **cuts days of manual work to minutes**, keeps all context in one place, and lets the planner iterate (‚Äúadd a workshop,‚Äù ‚Äúmake it hybrid‚Äù) with a single prompt.

### Who are the intended users?

* **Event-agency planners** who prepare multiple client proposals.
* **Corporate planners** who must respect internal policies yet still wow stakeholders.

---

### How will you integrate GenAI meaningfully?

* **LangChain + Weaviate RAG** over *user-supplied* documents‚Äîno external scraping‚Äîso every suggestion is grounded in the customer‚Äôs own industry context.
* **Adaptive dialogue** powered by an LLM that follows nine standard conception steps, probes for missing details, remembers answers, and supports unlimited refinements.
* **Creative synthesis** prompt chains craft themes, agendas, and curated speaker/sponsor lists that reflect both uploaded content and the evolving conversation.
* **Continuous learning**‚Äîeach new debrief or guideline embedded today improves tomorrow‚Äôs concepts automatically.

### Describe some scenarios how your app will function

**Co-create a fresh pitch** ‚Äì The planner uploads last year‚Äôs debrief and a market white paper, then says ‚ÄúTarget 300 attendees, hybrid preferred.‚Äù The AI summarises the docs, asks two clarifiers (duration, networking preference), and returns a one-day concept. The planner adds, ‚ÄúInclude a hands-on workshop and make the theme more visionary.‚Äù The AI revises the agenda and title, then offers a ready-to-share PDF.

**Compliance-aware brainstorm** ‚Äì A corporate planner supplies the company‚Äôs policy handbook and audience personas. The AI filters speaker suggestions to fit policy, proposes an online format for global reach, and crafts sponsor packages aligned with brand guidelines. When the planner asks, ‚ÄúShorten it to a half-day and add a panel,‚Äù the AI updates the concept instantly.

**Learning loop** ‚Äì After an event, the planner uploads debrief notes (‚Äúneed stronger networking, ticket price felt high‚Äù). Next time, the AI automatically proposes an interactive networking segment and adjusted ticket tiers, then asks, ‚ÄúAnything else you‚Äôd like to refine?‚Äù‚Äîkeeping the focus on creative improvement instead of administrative grind.

## üèó Architecture

The system follows a modular microservice architecture with clearly separated concerns across backend services, a modern web frontend, and scalable data infrastructure.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The project is split into several main directories:

- `/api`: OpenAPI specifications (single source of truth)
- `/client`: Angular 19 frontend  
- `/gateway`: API Gateway (Spring Boot) - Routing, JWT validation, OpenAPI docs
- `/user-svc`: User Service (Spring Boot) - Authentication, user management
- `/concept-svc`: Concept Service (Spring Boot) - Event concept CRUD, PDF export
- `/genai-svc`: GenAI Service (Python/Flask/LangChain) - Document processing, RAG pipeline

## üîÑ API-First Development

This project follows an API-first development approach. All API changes start with updating the OpenAPI specifications in the `/api` directory.

### API Directory Structure

```
/api                    # API specifications (single source of truth)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gateway.yaml      # API Gateway specification  
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-service.yaml # User Service specification
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ concept-service.yaml # Concept Service specification
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ genai-service.yaml # GenAI Service specification
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/          # Code generation scripts
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # API documentation
```

### Interactive API Documentation

- **Local Development**: Run `./start-docs.sh` to launch Swagger UI for all services
- **Documentation Hub**: `docs/index.html` provides unified access to all API docs
- **Individual Specs**: Each service OpenAPI spec can be viewed independently

### API-First Engineering Process  
1. **Design**: Update OpenAPI specifications first
2. **Validate**: Automated linting and specification validation  
3. **Generate**: Code generation from specifications
4. **Test**: API contract testing and validation
5. **Deploy**: Automated CI/CD pipeline deployment

**Engineering Process Evidence:**
- ‚úÖ **Documented Requirements**: Clear API contracts in `/api` directory
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Models**: UML diagrams (Analysis Object Model, Use Case, Component)
- ‚úÖ **API-First Workflow**: Specifications drive implementation
- ‚úÖ **Automated Validation**: Pre-commit hooks and CI pipeline checks
